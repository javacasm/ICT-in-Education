* Making things (Physical Computing)

  * Programming: Scratch, blockly
  * Electronics: Using modular Electronics
  * 3D Designing: Freecad
  * 3D Printing: Reprap

  ## 3DPrinting

  ![i2](./images/i2.jpg)

Using:
  * Arduino
  * Freecad
  * Open Hardware [RepRap](http://reprap.org/)


  How does 3d Printing work?
